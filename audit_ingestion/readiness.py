audit_ingestion_v05/audit_ingestion/readiness.py

Evidence readiness engine.

Computes readiness_status and blocking_state from the extracted flags,
then generates structured Question objects for each unresolved issue.

Two separate concerns:
  1. Was the file technically processed? (IngestionResult.status — success/partial/failed)
  2. Is the evidence complete enough for audit use? (ReadinessResult — ready/needs_*/unusable)

A file can be SUCCESS with confidence 1.00 and still not be Ready if it has a
missing period, unconfirmed TB year, or material balance difference.
